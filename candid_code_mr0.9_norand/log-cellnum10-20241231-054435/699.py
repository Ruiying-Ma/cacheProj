# Put the metadata specifically maintained by the policy below. The policy maintains a Quantum Lattice Framework that represents cache entries as nodes in a lattice structure, with edges representing access frequency and recency. It also tracks an Entropic Cascade Network to measure the entropy of access patterns, and a Temporal Signal Pathway to monitor time-based access trends. Dynamic Entropy Adjustment is used to adaptively tune the sensitivity of the policy to changes in access patterns.

    The policy chooses the eviction victim by identifying nodes in the Quantum Lattice with the lowest combined frequency and recency scores, adjusted by the current entropy level from the Entropic Cascade Network. Nodes with low temporal signal strength are prioritized for eviction, ensuring that the cache adapts to both stable and volatile access patterns.

Dynamic Entropy Adjustment recalibrates the sensitivity to recent access patterns.

    This function defines how the policy updates the metadata it maintains immediately after inserting a new object into the cache.
    After inserting a new object, the policy initializes its node in the Quantum Lattice with baseline frequency and recency scores, integrates it into the Entropic Cascade Network with initial entropy values, and marks the current time in the Temporal Signal Pathway. Dynamic Entropy Adjustment is applied to ensure the cache remains responsive to new access patterns.
