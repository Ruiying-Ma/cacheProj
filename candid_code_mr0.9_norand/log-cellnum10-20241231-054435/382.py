The policy maintains a Quantum Feedback Loop (QFL) index for each cache entry, a Temporal Signal Processing (TSP) score, a Heuristic Optimization Index (HOI), and an Entropic Drift Modulation (EDM) value. The QFL index tracks the quantum state transitions of cache entries, the TSP score captures temporal access patterns, the HOI reflects the efficiency of cache usage, and the EDM value measures the randomness in access patterns.

    This function defines how the policy chooses the eviction victim.
    The policy chooses the eviction victim by selecting the entry with the lowest combined score of QFL, TSP, and HOI, adjusted by the EDM value. This approach ensures that entries with stable access patterns and high optimization potential are retained, while those with high entropic drift are more likely to be evicted.

    Upon a cache hit, the QFL index is incremented to reflect the reinforcement of the entry's quantum state. The TSP score is updated to account for the recent access, increasing its weight in the temporal pattern. The HOI is recalculated to reflect improved cache efficiency, and the EDM value is adjusted to decrease, indicating reduced randomness.
