# Put the metadata specifically maintained by the policy below. The policy maintains a hyperdimensional matrix representing cache entries, where each dimension corresponds to a unique attribute of the data. It also tracks a quantum harmonic oscillator-inspired phase for each entry, which represents the likelihood of future access, and a neural phase coupling index that indicates the interdependencies between cache entries. An adaptive frequency modulator adjusts the access frequency of each entry based on recent usage patterns.

    The policy selects the eviction victim by identifying the cache entry with the lowest combined score of phase amplitude and neural phase coupling index, indicating low likelihood of future access and minimal interdependency with other entries. The adaptive frequency modulator further refines this choice by deprioritizing entries with decreasing access frequency.
