# Put the metadata specifically maintained by the policy below. The policy maintains a Composite Semantic Matrix (CSM) that integrates access frequency, last access timestamp, Quantum Phase Entropy, Neural Network Bias, Predictive State Transition matrix, locality score, access latency tracker, hit-miss ratio tracker, fault tolerance levels, Semantic Fusion Map clusters, Predictive Resonance Scores, Temporal Flux Counters, and a Hierarchical Encoding Tree. It dynamically adjusts weights and relationships between these metrics to optimize for both redundancy and contextual importance.
