# Put the metadata specifically maintained by the policy below. The policy maintains access frequency, last access timestamp, replication factor, network latency, fault tolerance level, quantum state vector, heuristic fusion score, adaptive resonance level, temporal distortion factor, cache alignment, access latency, storage stratification (hot, warm, cold tiers), and data pipelining patterns. It integrates quantum-inspired metrics with tiered storage and sequential access tracking for holistic optimization.
