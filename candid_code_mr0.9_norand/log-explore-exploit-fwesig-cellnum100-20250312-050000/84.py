    The policy calculates a hybrid composite eviction score by combining low access frequency, high network latency, low replication factor, high Quantum Phase Entropy, low Neural Network Bias, weak heuristic fusion, low adaptive resonance, high temporal distortion, low coherence score, low predictive eviction score, and low priority levels. Dynamic weight adjustments are applied based on workload trends, and the entry with the lowest score is evicted. Fault tolerance levels and the fault-tolerance-coherence metric are used as tiebreakers.
