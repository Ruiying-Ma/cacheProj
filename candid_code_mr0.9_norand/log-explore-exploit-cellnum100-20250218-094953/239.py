    This function defines how the policy chooses the eviction victim.
    The policy first checks if SQ exceeds its capacity and moves objects to MQ if necessary. If MQ is full, it cyclically reduces the frequency of objects until an object with zero frequency is found and evicts it. If SQ is not full, it selects the eviction victim based on the lowest combined score of access frequency, temporal locality, and predicted future access time, adjusted by the global adaptive threshold. If multiple candidates exist, the one with the highest anomaly score and lowest replication factor is chosen.
