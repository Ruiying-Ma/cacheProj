    This function defines how the policy chooses the eviction victim.
    The policy identifies eviction candidates by combining the lowest dynamic priority scores, quantum coherence scores, and cognitive scores adjusted by an adaptive threshold. Among these candidates, it uses a weighted round-robin approach considering recent synchronization activity, context tags, and the predictive model's least likely to be accessed prediction. If multiple candidates exist, the one with the lowest replication factor and least recent access pattern is chosen.
