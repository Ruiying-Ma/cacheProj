It then evaluates the combined score of resilience, heuristic fusion, and adaptive resonance adjusted by temporal distortion, refined by Bayesian network, multi-armed bandit, and GAN predictions. The object with the lowest refined score is evicted. If scores are tied, the object at the current pointer location is evicted.
