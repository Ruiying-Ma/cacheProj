    This function defines how the policy chooses the eviction victim.
    The policy first checks if SQ is full. If so, it moves objects from SQ to T2 until an object with frequency less than 2 is found or T2 is full. If T2 is full, it reduces the frequency of objects in T2 until an object with zero frequency is found and evicts it. If SQ is not full, it evicts the object from the front of SQ. If further eviction is needed, it identifies the non-empty LRU queue with the smallest subscript and evicts the node with the lowest combination of connection score and access frequency within that queue.
