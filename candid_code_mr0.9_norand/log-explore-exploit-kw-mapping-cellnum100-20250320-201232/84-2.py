    This function defines how the policy chooses the eviction victim.
    The policy chooses the eviction victim based on the lowest priority level, considering both access frequency and recency. If multiple items have the same priority, the least recently synchronized item is evicted first. If SQ exceeds its capacity, move objects from SQ to MQ until an object with frequency less than 2 is found or MQ is full. If MQ is full, cyclically reduce frequencies in MQ until an object with zero frequency is found and evict it. Evicted items are moved to the overflow area and GQ.
