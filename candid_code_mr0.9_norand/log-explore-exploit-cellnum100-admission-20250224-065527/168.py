    An object is admitted if it is in the ghost LRU queue or meets a combination of low redundancy, high query frequency, high consistency score, low failure detection count, high resource allocation priority, and a predetermined admission probability. If not in the ghost LRU queue, admission is also based on a predetermined probability.
