# Put the metadata specifically maintained by the policy below. The policy maintains a hash map with data block identifiers as keys and tuples containing access frequency, timestamp of last access, latency to fetch, node communication cost, fault recovery importance, data replication factor, query frequency count, data partitioning tag access count, SQL injection risk score, concurrency access patterns, object size, quantum-computed predictive score, and differential privacy noise factor. It also uses a Bloom filter for access frequency approximation and a counter for total disk accesses.
