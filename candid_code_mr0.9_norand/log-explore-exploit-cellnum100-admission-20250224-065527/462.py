    The policy uses a combination of QNN trust score, replication factor, consistency score, failure detection count, resource allocation priority, admission probability, encryption status, network latency, load balancing, throughput optimization, current load factor, storage allocation, and dynamic threshold based on cache load and blockchain consensus to determine if an object should be admitted.
