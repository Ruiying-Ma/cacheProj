    This function defines how the policy determines whether an object should be admitted into the cache.
    The policy admits an object into the cache if the current load is below a dynamic threshold based on peak load and system throughput, or if its frequency of access exceeds a threshold, the total number of disk accesses since the last admission exceeds a limit, or if it belongs to a high-access shard and contributes to query optimization without significantly increasing resource usage. Additionally, the machine learning model predicts the likelihood of future accesses, and if the prediction exceeds a certain threshold and the data is encrypted, the object is admitted.
