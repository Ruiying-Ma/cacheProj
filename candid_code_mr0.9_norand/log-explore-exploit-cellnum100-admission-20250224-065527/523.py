    This function defines how the policy determines whether an object should be admitted into the cache.
    The policy admits an object if its access frequency exceeds a threshold, the total number of disk accesses since the last admission exceeds a predefined limit, the object meets a combined score based on encryption status, network latency, load balancing, throughput optimization, privacy score, and if adding it improves the global sustainability score. AI governance dynamically adjusts these thresholds.
