    The policy determines whether an object should be admitted into the cache based on a combination of predefined admission probability, encryption status, network latency, load balancing, throughput optimization, current load factor, storage allocation for the object's type, predictive model accuracy, data parsing efficiency, request queue length, and cache hit ratio.
    - Args:
        - `cache_snapshot`: A snapshot of the current cache state.
        - `obj`: The object being requested.
        - `key_to_be_evicted`: The key of the object in the cache that may be evicted if the currently requested object is admitted and triggers an eviction. If no admission occurs or if admission does not cause an eviction, this is set to `None`.
    - Return:
        - `should_admit`: A boolean value indicating whether the requested object should be admitted into the cache. If `True`, the object is admitted; if `False`, it is not.
