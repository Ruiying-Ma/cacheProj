    This function defines how the policy determines whether an object should be admitted into the cache.
    The policy first checks if the object is in the ghost LRU queue. If it is, the object is admitted. If not, the policy computes a predictive score using quantum computing and admits the object if the score is above a dynamic threshold. The dynamic threshold is adjusted using edge orchestration.
