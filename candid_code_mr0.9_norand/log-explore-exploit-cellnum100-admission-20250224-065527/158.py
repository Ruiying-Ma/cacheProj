    This function defines how the policy determines whether an object should be admitted into the cache.
    The policy determines whether an object should be admitted into the cache based on the neural network's confidence score, cognitive computing-based priority score, and a predefined admission probability. The decision also considers encryption status, network latency, load balancing, throughput optimization, current load factor, and storage allocation for the object's type.
    - Args:
        - `cache_snapshot`: A snapshot of the current cache state.
        - `obj`: The object being requested.
        - `key_to_be_evicted`: The key of the object in the cache that may be evicted if the currently requested object is admitted and triggers an eviction. If no admission occurs or if admission does not cause an eviction, this is set to `None`.
