    This function defines how the policy determines whether an object should be admitted into the cache.
    The policy admits an object into the cache if the current bandwidth utilization is below a certain threshold, the queue depth is manageable, and the object size does not exceed a predefined limit. Additionally, it considers the predictive maintenance cycle to ensure the cache is not overloaded during maintenance periods.

        - `cache_snapshot`: A snapshot of the current cache state.
        - `obj`: The object being requested.
        - `key_to_be_evicted`: The key of the object in the cache that may be evicted if the currently requested object is admitted and triggers an eviction. If no admission occurs or if admission does not cause an eviction, this is set to `None`.
    - Return:
        - `should_admit`: A boolean value indicating whether the requested object should be admitted into the cache. If `True`, the object is admitted; if `False`, it is not.
